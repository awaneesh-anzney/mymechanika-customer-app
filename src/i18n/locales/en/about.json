        "p1": "Founded in 2018, MyMechanika started with a simple mission: to bring transparency and convenience to car servicing. We noticed that car owners often faced hidden charges, poor quality parts, and unreliable service providers.",
        "p2": "We set out to change this by building a network of certified mechanics, partnering with OEM suppliers, and creating a technology platform that gives car owners complete visibility into their service.",
        "p3": "Today, we've serviced over 2 million cars across 50+ cities, and we're just getting started. Our vision is to be every car owner's trusted partner for all their vehicle needs.",
